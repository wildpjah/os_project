So far, this is just the framework for our project.
We have a class object for each of the important categories in the game.
Room, Miner, and Gamer.
These need to be expanded so that they cannot break any of the requirements and they perform the required actions.
We also need to implement parallel computing to simulate players and miners moving at the same time.
Our main file will run all of the actual operations.
